# Find me something to read!
I wrote this utility to extract the most value from two services I love dearly:

- Goodreads
- The Seattle Public Library system

## How I use it
Whenever I come across a title I'd like to read some day, I store it on my
Goodreads shelf. When I'd like to visit my local library branch, I run this
script, and it will tell me which titles are available to be checked out.

## Why?
I live in a wonderfully tech-oriented city. Our libraries have blazing-fast
internet access and the entire catalog is accessible via a public API. However,
my local library branch does not have the most extensive collection. Instead of
meandering the stacks until I find a book I like, or fruitlessly querying the
catalog to see if that interesting new book is on the shelf, I'd much rather
have a script do the hard work for me.
